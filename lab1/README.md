A to-do list app that keeps list items in an array.

The app must offer these features:

- Add a to-do list item
- Mark a to-do list item as done
- Delete a to-do list item

Some questions to ask:

- What data do I need to take from the user?
- What state does my application manage?
- What are the possible actions that change the state?
- How can I write code that's easy to be tested
  programmatically by other code?

The test-driven development (TDD) methodology:

Starting from stable code that is covered by tests,
- add a failing test case
- write only the code that makes that case pass
- refactor as needed
- repeat!
