# S-22 Lab Exercises Collaboration Policy

Since this code is not part of a problem set nor an exam, you may share your
work on these exercises freely with fellow students.

During class, may can follow me as I build a solution, or you can go into a
breakout room with one or more of your peers, or you can hack alone and let me
know if you get stuck.

Our solution is freely available in this repository.
